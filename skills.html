												<h3>Python</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Python has been a cornerstone of my programming journey. Introduced to it alongside Java 
												and C++ during my undergraduate studies, I quickly recognized its versatility and readability. 
												Beyond academic projects, I applied Python to my final year project, where it served as 
												the backbone for a machine learning model.<br>
												My professional career further solidified my Python expertise. At Verizon, I leveraged 
												Django's Python framework to build robust web applications, contributing significantly to 
												the Device Forum platform. This role allowed me to master full-stack development, from database 
												interactions to user interface design.<br>
												Returning to academia for my Master's, I delved deeper into Python's scientific computing 
												capabilities. PyTorch became my tool of choice for manipulating Large Language Models (LLMs) 
												and simulating complex systems like robotic chess and football players. These experiences 
												have refined my ability to apply Python across diverse domains, from web development to 
												artificial intelligence.

												<h3>Django</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I gained my initial exposure to Django while at Verizon, where I played a pivotal role in 
												building the Device Forum platform. As part of a cross-functional team, I was responsible 
												for designing, developing, and optimizing backend functionalities using Django and React. 
												This experience honed my skills in building scalable and efficient web applications, from 
												managing complex project workflows and collaborating with product owners to implementing 
												robust features and optimizing performance on AWS.<br>
												To maintain and enhance my Django proficiency, I recently undertook a personal project to 
												develop a blog application. This hands-on experience allowed me to reinforce core Django 
												concepts, such as user authentication, content management, and deployment strategies. I 
												successfully deployed the application to both Linux and Heroku environments, demonstrating 
												my ability to create functional and user-friendly web applications.<br>
												Currently, I'm immersed in a project focused exclusively on building RESTful APIs using 
												Django as well as integrating my Djnago skills with some Deep learning model to analyse 
												and predict, further deepening my understanding of the capabilities for data-driven applications.

												With a strong foundation in PyTorch, I have successfully developed and implemented deep 
												learning models for complex problem-solving. During my Master's degree, I delved into the 
												intricacies of PyTorch to create sophisticated neural networks tailored to specific research 
												objectives.<br>
												A highlight of my PyTorch experience was the development of a novel deep learning model 
												for my dissertation. This involved a meticulous exploration of BERT architecture, where 
												I manipulated layers to optimize performance for predicting unique and rare algorithms. 
												This project showcased my ability to leverage PyTorch's flexibility and efficiency to 
												build cutting-edge solutions.

												My AWS journey began unexpectedly at Verizon. Thrust into a project already deployed on AWS, 
												I quickly realized the necessity of understanding foundational services like EC2, S3, and RDS. 
												This was no leisurely exploration; it was a baptism by fire. Any modification to the production 
												environment required not only my knowledge but also rigorous scrutiny from the infrastructure 
												team. These initial challenges transformed into a solid foundation for my AWS skillset, preparing 
												me for more complex challenges.
